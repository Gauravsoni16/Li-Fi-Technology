        <h3>
        Professor Harald Haas and his team of researchers are pioneers in the field of LiFi. They began their research into VLC technology as early as 2006. Much of their research ventured into the use of light as a medium for two-way transmission of data, which paved the way for LiFi technology.
        
        Although it wasnâ€™t the exact moment it was invented, the term LiFi was introduced to the world in 2011 during his TED Talk. The talk was entitled Wireless Data from Every Lightbulb. It was at the talk where he coined the term Light Fidelity (LiFi), a play on the term Wireless Fidelity (WiFi). To demonstrate the capabilities of the new technology, Prof. Haas provided a live demonstration by streaming a large, high-definition video from a standard LED lamp.
        
        Prof. Haas helped start a company that would market LiFi technology in 2012. The company was named pureVLC, but was later renamed pureLiFi, and was an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that was set to commercialize LiFi products and push for their integration with existing LED-lighting systems.
        
        Through the years, pureLiFi was able to produce a variety of LiFi products designed for easy integration of LiFi into existing devices.
